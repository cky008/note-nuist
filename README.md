1. The order is received and checked.  
2. Customers are checked to see if they are on the customer database.  
3. New customers are entered onto the database.  
4. The customer is checked for credit worthiness.  
5. If the credit check is positive, the order is processed and confirmation is sent to the customer.  
6. If the credit check is questionable the finance department will advise whether to proceed with the order.  
  a. If the order is to proceed a confirmation will be sent to the customer that the goods will be supplied on a cash on delivery (COD) basis.  
  b. If the order is not to proceed a message will be sent to the customer that the order cannot be fulfilled.  
7. For orders that are to proceed a requirements list is produced.

4. A work order is produced.  
5. A product delivery schedule is produced and sent to the customer.  
6. Parts from the parts supplier are received.  
7. The products are assembled.  
8. Products are delivered to the warehouse.
